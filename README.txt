This is a collection of programs that allow you to play hangman.
It contains a two-player version, two versions where you can play against the computer and a function I wrote to trim down the word list I downloaded online.

It features drawings of the hangman reflecting your progress, and how close you are to losing. Additionally, in hangmanv2, shorter words get fewer guesses.
